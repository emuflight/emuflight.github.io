- EmuFlight flightcode has unique methods and characteristics.
- Free Open-Source Software for racing and freestyle drones.
- Provided under General Public License (GPL) for use and modification in any way and without Warranty of any kind.

## [](#header-2)News

- New to EmuFlight and just want to get started? See the [Installation Section](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/wiki/Installing-EmuFlight).
- Feature listing per firmware milestone are in the [What makes EmuFlight different?](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/wiki/What-makes-EmuFlight-different%3F) link.

## [](#header-3)In-Flux Defaults

Default settings as well as CLI commands have changed from one version to the next. We try to list these under the version Release-Notes. A recommended method to keep track of configurations and changes is:

- Save both a `diff all` and `dump all` from your quads before updating.
- Save a `dump all` containing defaults for each freshly flashed EmuFlight version and save such with "defaults" in the filename.

## [](#header-4)Firmware Releases

Releases can be found here: [https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/releases](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight/releases) or downloaded from [EmuConfigurator](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuConfigurator/releases). Recommended to always check Release-Notes and other Details on the various versions.

To configure EmuFlight you should use the latest stable emuflight-configurator GUI tool (Windows/OSX/Linux) that can be found here: [https://github.com/emuflight/EmuConfigurator/releases](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuConfigurator/releases).
